# So You Wana Be an AI Engineer?

Ok, I think most people do not want to be an AI Engineer.

Being an __AI Scientist__ is more sexy & is always at the front & center of all the bosses, with smooches for executing seemingly difficult but yet copied from the latest SOTA open-sourced models. But who cares, the model works, the attention & prestige is nice, & hey, they have PhDs even though their theses has nothing to do with AI.

__AI Engineers__ though, are the unsung heros. They understand modelling, they understand engineering, and heck, they know how to do almost anything! Database, web development, cloud engineering, application testing, deployment, and certainly how to train a SOTA model from an open-coded repository too. Imagine a small data science team or during a crisis period, will they hire/retain an AI Scientist? Or an AI Engineer?

Besides the full stack technical capabilities, good AI Engineers also need to have certain attributes. 

 * An incredible intolerance for slobby work
 * Great organizational abilities
 * A demand for reproductible work with strong documentation. 
  
Such a wide range of expertise is difficult to find, so a company who values AI Engineers will not devalue them in terms of compensation.

Now that I'm done with the rambling, if you are still convinced, let's hope on to some basics.
