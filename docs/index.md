# So You Wana Be an AI Engineer?

Ok, I think most people do not aspire to be an AI Engineer.

<hr>

Being an __AI Scientist__ is sexier & is always at the front & center of bosses, consistently serenaded with smooches for executing seemingly difficult, but yet `git clone` from the latest SOTA open-sourced repositories. But who cares, the model works, the attention & prestige is nice, & hey, they have PhDs even though their theses, more often than not, has nothing to do with AI. :shushing_face:

<hr>

__AI Engineers__ though, are the unsung heros. They understand modelling, they understand engineering, and heck, they know how to do almost anything! Database, web development, cloud engineering, testing, deployment, and certainly how to train a SOTA model from an open-sourced repository too. :wink: In fact, a mature system may contain only 5% of machine learning code, highlighting the need for a diversified skillset.

Besides their full stack technical capabilities, good AI Engineers also possess certain critical attributes.

 * An incredible intolerance for slobby work
 * Great organizational abilities
 * A demand for reproducible work with strong documentation. 
  
Such a wide range of expertise is difficult to find, so a company who values AI Engineers will not devalue them in terms of compensation.

<hr>

Still not convinced? Well, I would say that I have seen a number of AI Scientists starting to learn more engineering aspects of AI. Heck, even they secretly aspire to be an AI Engineer, though they still want to wear their fancy scientists' hats. :grinning:

Now that I'm done with the rambling, if you are ready to hop on the bandwagon, let's start with some basics.
